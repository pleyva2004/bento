# GPT-4 Turbo: What It Means for Enterprise AI

OpenAI's latest release of GPT-4 Turbo brings significant improvements for enterprise applications. We've been testing it extensively and want to share our findings.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Extended Context Window

The new 128K token context window is a game-changer for:

- Processing entire documents
- Maintaining conversation history
- Complex multi-step reasoning
- Enterprise knowledge bases

### 2. Improved Accuracy

Our benchmarks show:

- 23% fewer hallucinations on factual queries
- 31% better performance on complex reasoning tasks
- Significantly improved JSON mode reliability

### 3. Cost Reduction

- 3x cheaper than GPT-4
- 2x faster response times
- Better rate limits for enterprise use

## What This Means for Levrok

We're immediately integrating GPT-4 Turbo into our platform, which will enable:

- More accurate decision recommendations
- Better context understanding
- Faster response times
- Lower costs for our customers

## Migration Timeline

- **This week**: Testing in sandbox environments
- **Next week**: Gradual rollout to production
- **Two weeks**: Full migration complete

Existing customers will automatically benefit from these improvements with no action required.
